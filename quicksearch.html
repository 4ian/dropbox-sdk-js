"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Dropbox JavaScript SDK Classes DropboxDropboxTeam Dropbox JavaScript SDK Documentation The Dropbox JavaScript SDK is a lightweight, promise based interface to the Dropbox v2 API that works in both nodejs and browser environments. InstallationNpmUse npm for nodejs, webpack or browserify: $ npm install dropbox --saveScript tagThe UMD build is available on npmcdn: &lt;script src=&quot;https://npmcdn.com/dropbox/dist/Dropbox-sdk.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;You can find the library on window.Dropbox. UsageBrowser with &lt;script&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://npmcdn.com/dropbox/dist/Dropbox-sdk.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; var dbx = new Dropbox({ accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE' }); dbx.filesListFolder({path: ''}) .then(function(response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function(error) { console.log(error); }); &lt;/script&gt;Nodejs, Browserify or Webpackvar Dropbox = require('dropbox'); var dbx = new Dropbox({ accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE' }); dbx.filesListFolder({path: ''}) .then(function(response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function(error) { console.log(error); });General documentationEndpointsFor documentation of all of the available endpoints, the parameters they receive and the data they return, see the Dropbox class definition. These methods are all available directly from an instance of the API class, ex: dbx.filesListFolder(). TeamsThe Dropbox API has a series of actions that can be completed on a team wide level. These endpoint methods are available by using the DropboxTeam class. It can be loaded like this: var DropboxTeam = require('dropbox/team');. For more information , see the DropboxTeam class definition. AuthenticationThe Dropbox SDK uses OAuth2 for authorizing API requests. Dropbox requires an access token to make authenticated requests. The access token can be supplied at instantiation or set later using the setAccessToken() method. Dropbox.getAuthenticationUrl() is a method that is very helpful for authenticating users. See the authentication example for a basic example of how it can be used. For more information on how to obtain an access token using OAuth, please see our OAuth Guide. Promises implementationThe SDK returns Promises using the native Promise implementation and polyfills with jakearchibald/es6-promise when needed. Unsupported API EndpointsThe SDK doesn't current have support for the Content-upload or Content-download endpoints. We are actively developing these and expect them to be released soon. ExamplesSee examples/ for working examples of how the SDK can be used in a few different environments. VersioningWe will try to follow semver as close as possible. That means bug fixes will be patch releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 1.0.2), additional functionality like new endpoints will be minor releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 1.1.0) and breaking changes to both the library and the API endpoints it hits, will be major releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 2.0.0). × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 on 2016-06-10T15:31:38-04:00 using the DocStrap template.

In conjunction with list_folder/continue, this call gives you a low-latency way to monitor an account for file changes. The connection will block until there are changes available or a timeout occurs. This endpoint is useful mostly for client-side apps. If you're looking for server-side notifications, check out our webhooks documentation https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/webhooks. Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters. Properties Name Type Description cursor String A cursor as returned by list_folder or list_folder/continue. Cursors retrieved by setting ListFolderArg.include_media_info to true are not supported. timeout Number A timeout in seconds.
