"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Dropbox JavaScript SDK Classes Routes Dropbox JavaScript SDKThe Dropbox JavaScript SDK is lightweight and provides a promise based interface to the Dropbox v2 API that works in both nodejs and browser environments. Table of Contents Installation Usage Examples Documentation Versioning Contributing InstallationnpmUse npm for nodejs, webpack or browserify: $ npm install dropbox --save&lt;script&gt;The UMD build is available on npmcdn: &lt;script src=&quot;https://npmcdn.com/dropbox/umd/dropbox-sdk.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;You can find the library on window.Dropbox. UsageBrowser with &lt;script&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://npmcdn.com/dropbox/umd/dropbox-sdk.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; var dbx = new Dropbox({ accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE' }); dbx.filesListFolder({path: '/'}) .then(function(response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function(error) { console.log(error); }); &lt;/script&gt;Nodejs, Browserify or Webpackvar Dropbox = require('dropbox'); var dbx = new Dropbox({ accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE' }); dbx.filesListFolder({path: '/'}) .then(function(response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function(error) { console.log(error); });ExamplesSee examples/ for working examples of how the SDK can be used in a few different environments. DocumentationAuthenticationThe Dropbox SDK uses OAuth2 for authorizing API requests. Dropbox requires an access token to make authenticated requests. The access token can be supplied at instantiation or set later using the setAccessToken() method. Dropbox.getAuthenticationUrl() is a method that is very helpful for authenticating users. See the authentication example for a basic example of how it can be used. For more information on how to obtain an access token using OAuth, please see our OAuth Guide. EndpointsFor documentation of all of the available endpoints, the parameters they receive and the data they return, see src/routes.js. These methods are all available directly from an instance of the API class, ex: dbx.filesListFolder(). @TODO: Autogenerate docs from JSDocs in routes.js. Promises implementationThe SDK returns Promises using the native Promise implementation and polyfills with jakearchibald/es6-promise when needed. VersioningWe will try to follow semver as close as possible. That means bug fixes will be patch releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 1.0.2), additional functionality like new endpoints will be minor releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 1.1.0) and breaking changes to both the library and the API endpoints it hits, will be major releases (1.0.1 -&gt; 2.0.0). ContributingPlease see CONTRIBUTING.md for information on how to contribute, setup the development environment and run tests. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 on 2016-06-06T14:32:13-04:00 using the DocStrap template. "},"Routes.html":{"id":"Routes.html","title":"Class: Routes","body":" Dropbox JavaScript SDK Classes Routes Class: Routes Routes Contains a corresponding method for each route. new Routes() Methods authTokenRevoke(arg) Disables the access token used to authenticate the call. Parameters: Name Type Description arg null The request parameters. Returns: Type null filesCopy(arg) Copy a file or folder to a different location in the user's Dropbox.

Returns: Type Object filesCopyReferenceGet(arg) Get a copy reference to a file or folder. This reference string can be used to save that file or folder to another user's Dropbox by passing it to copy_reference/save. Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters. Properties Name Type Description path String The path to the file or folder you want to get a copy reference to. Returns: Type Object filesCopyReferenceSave(arg) Save a copy reference returned by copy_reference/get to the user's Dropbox. Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters.

Properties Name Type Description path String Path in the user's Dropbox to create. Returns: Type Object filesDelete(arg) Delete the file or folder at a given path. If the path is a folder, all its contents will be deleted too. A successful response indicates that the file or folder was deleted. The returned metadata will be the corresponding FileMetadata or FolderMetadata for the item at time of deletion, and not a DeletedMetadata object. Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters. Properties Name Type Description path String Path in the user's Dropbox to delete. Returns: Type Object filesGetMetadata(arg) Returns the metadata for a file or folder. Note: Metadata for the root folder is unsupported. Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters.

Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters. Properties Name Type Description cursor String The cursor returned by your last call to list_folder or list_folder/continue. Returns: Type Object filesListFolderGetLatestCursor(arg) A way to quickly get a cursor for the folder's state. Unlike list_folder, list_folder/get_latest_cursor doesn't return any entries. This endpoint is for app which only needs to know about new files and modifications and doesn't need to know about files that already exist in Dropbox. Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters. Properties Name Type Description path String The path to the folder you want to see the contents of. recursive Boolean If true, the list folder operation will be applied recursively to all subfolders and the response will contain contents of all subfolders. include_media_info Boolean If true, FileMetadata.media_info is set for photo and video. include_deleted Boolean If true, the results will include entries for files and folders that used to exist but were deleted. include_has_explicit_shared_members Boolean If true, the results will include a flag for each file indicating whether or not that file has any explicit members. Returns: Type Object filesListFolderLongpoll(arg) A longpoll endpoint to wait for changes on an account. In conjunction with list_folder/continue, this call gives you a low-latency way to monitor an account for file changes. The connection will block until there are changes available or a timeout occurs. This endpoint is useful mostly for client-side apps. If you're looking for server-side notifications, check out our webhooks documentation https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/webhooks. Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters. Properties Name Type Description cursor String A cursor as returned by list_folder or list_folder/continue. Cursors retrieved by setting ListFolderArg.include_media_info to true are not supported. timeout Number A timeout in seconds. The request will block for at most this length of time, plus up to 90 seconds of random jitter added to avoid the thundering herd problem. Care should be taken when using this parameter, as some network infrastructure does not support long timeouts.

Parameters: Name Type Description arg Object The request parameters. Properties Name Type Description path String The path in the user's Dropbox to search. Should probably be a folder. query String The string to search for. The search string is split on spaces into multiple tokens. For file name searching, the last token is used for prefix matching (i.e. &quot;bat c&quot; matches &quot;bat cave&quot; but not &quot;batman car&quot;). start Number The starting index within the search results (used for paging). max_results Number The maximum number of search results to return. mode Object The search mode (filename, filename_and_content, or deleted_filename).

Returns: Type Object sharingCreateSharedLink(arg) Create a shared link. If a shared link already exists for the given path, that link is returned. Note that in the returned PathLinkMetadata, the PathLinkMetadata.url field is the shortened URL if CreateSharedLinkArg.short_url argument is set to true. Previously, it was technically possible to break a shared link by moving or renaming the corresponding file or folder. In the future, this will no longer be the case, so your app shouldn't rely on this behavior. Instead, if your app needs to revoke a shared link, use revoke_shared_link.

Returns: Type Object sharingGetSharedLinks(arg) Returns a list of LinkMetadata objects for this user, including collection links. If no path is given or the path is empty, returns a list of all shared links for the current user, including collection links.
